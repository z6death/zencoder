Space is the vast expanse that exists beyond Earth's atmosphere, starting about 62 miles (100 kilometers) above sea level. It is mostly a near-perfect vacuum, containing very low levels of matter, such as gas and dust, and is characterized by extreme cold and the absence of air, which means sound cannot travel. The universe, which includes all of space, matter, and energy, is believed to be around 13.8 billion years old and continues to expand. Understanding space is crucial for exploring celestial bodies, studying the origins of the universe, and advancing technology for space travel
